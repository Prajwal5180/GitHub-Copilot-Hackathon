## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following from the CloudLabs-provided integrated environment:

- Basic understanding of the C# programming language.  
- GitHub account.
- Create a folder named **GitHub Copilot** in **C:\Users\azureuser**.

## Setting Up Visual Studio Code

1. Sign in to Visual Studio Code using your GitHub User credentials.

2. Navigate to the GitHub repository [CloudLabsAI-Azure/MyMvcApp-Contact-Databse-Application](https://github.com/CloudLabsAI-Azure/MyMvcApp-Contact-Databse-Application) and fork this repository using the CloudLabs-provided GitHub account.
   
3. Clone the forked repository into Visual Studio Code using the CloudLabs-provided GitHub account.

4. In your Visual Studio Code, navigate to **Extentions** and install **Nuget Gallery** and **C# Dev Kit**.

## Challenge Objectives  

1. **Develop an app:** 

      - You will be creating a CRUD application named **MyMvcApp**, a C# application, with the help of **Github Copilot**, which will let the users save the contact details of people as per requirements and also carry out the basic functions like editing their details, deleting their profiles, and so on. You will be provided with the skeleton of the application already, but you will need to build the functionalities inside the **UserController.cs** file by yourself. Your task is to complete these methods by utilizing GitHub Copilot to generate the necessary code, guided by the comments provided in the file.

      - Explore Copilot's ability to understand your context and provide relevant code suggestions.
        >**Hint:** Utilize GitHub Copilot's **Start in Editor**, **Fix** and **GitHub Copilot chat** features to develop the necessary code.

      - Test the application thoroughly and ensure all functionalities work as expected.

   <validation step="c7f107a0-97a2-4442-9cef-b14297fd5b7a" />

2. **Generate unit test case scripts and validate them**:

      - Run the below commands in command prompt to create a new folder named **MyMvcApp.Tests** in **C:\Users\azureuser\GitHub Copilot** for generating unit test cases.

        ```
        cd "C:\Users\azureuser\GitHub Copilot"
        ```
        ```
        dotnet new xunit -n MyMvcApp.Tests
        ```

      - In your Visual Studio Code, locate the **MyMvcApp.Tests** folder in the Solution Explorer, right click and select **Open in integrated terminal**. Run the below command in the terminal to add the dotnet package.

        ```
        dotnet add package Microsoft.CodeDom.Providers.DotNetCompilerPlatform
        ```
        
      - For each of the features in the **MyMvcApp** you built inside the **UserController.cs** file, generate unit test cases for the **UserControllerTests.cs** file by using **xunit** by utilizing **Github Copilot**.
        >**Hint:** Rename the **UnitTest1.cs** file to **UserControllerTests.cs** after creating the **MyMvcApp.Test** folder.

      - Run the required scripts generated by the **Github Copilot** and verify that all the unit test cases have passed.

3. **Develop and test features:** 

      - Once the methods are completed, the next step is to develop and add a search feature/functionality to the application and test out this feature thoroughly.
        
      - Utilize GitHub Copilot to generate code snippets for building the search feature.

      - Test the application and make sure that the search functionality is working as expected.
